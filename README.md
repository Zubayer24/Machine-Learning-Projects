## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to analyze the **heart failure clinical records** dataset and build a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of a **death event** in patients with heart failure. You will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, and apply classification models to predict the target variable.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 13 variables, each representing clinical features and demographic information of heart failure patients:

1. **age**: Age of the patient (years)
2. **anaemia**: Whether the patient has anaemia (0: no, 1: yes)
3. **creatinine_phosphokinase**: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
4. **diabetes**: Whether the patient has diabetes (0: no, 1: yes)
5. **ejection_fraction**: Percentage of blood leaving the heart with each contraction (%)
6. **high_blood_pressure**: Whether the patient has high blood pressure (0: no, 1: yes)
7. **platelets**: Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
8. **serum_creatinine**: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
9. **serum_sodium**: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
10. **sex**: Gender of the patient (1: male, 0: female)
11. **smoking**: Whether the patient smokes (0: no, 1: yes)
12. **time**: Follow-up period (days)
13. **DEATH_EVENT**: Whether the patient died during the follow-up period (0: no, 1: yes) [Target Variable]
